# Visual Activity Schedules for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder

_Visual Activity Schedules for Children with Autism Spectral Disorder (ASD) is a web application prototype I built in 2008 during my final quarter at UC Irvine for the Ubiquitous Computing project course taught by Assistant Professor of Informatics Gillian Hayes._

_Neither the application nor the presentation has been altered since then._

## What is an Activity Schedule?

An activity schedule is series of pictures or words used to cue an individual to perform a sequence of of activities. They're important because they provide a framework for children with ASD to learn the proper sequence of certain actions, to assist in choice making, and to foster a medium of communication. 

The most important feature visual schedules have is that they support change. A schedule may be altered due to a change in curriculum or an unexpected event. They may also change from visual to written cues once a person with ASD acquires certain language, or once a series of cues for an activity are memorized and can now be represented by a single cue. Lastly, many caretakers encourage physical interaction with with the schedule, so children may remove a cue from the board once the task is begun or completed. Some caretakers integrate choice boards, a selection of cues, for the child to communicate their choice for the next activity.

Activity schedules are usually constructed with written, drawn, or printed paper cut-outs which are then attached to some sort of board acting as a timeline. Since these timelines do change, caretakers ensure maximum reuse and flexibility using lamination, velcro, tape, and/or magnets. The boards themselves may be a clipboard, whiteboard, or a portion of wall.

Activity schedules have been successful in assisting children with ASD in following regiment, reacting to change, and to make choices when appropriate. They're an invaluable tool for the caretaker, but creating and maintaining the cues is a time-consuming process, as is configuring schedules each day. This is compounded when a caretaker manages multiple children, particularly when they are at different levels of development.

At UC Irvine I had an opportunity to read academic and professional literature regarding ASD and to brainstorm and discuss possible designs for a visual activity schedule using information technology. I implemented a basic visual schedule as a proof of concept which demonstrated the feasibility and possibilities of such a project.

## Brainstorming & Design

Together with Informatics graduate student Mo Manabi and undergraduate researcher Sam Kaufman I explored possible mediums, designs, and features of a visual activity schedule system.
