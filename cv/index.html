	<p>The California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) is a multidisciplinary research institute between <a href="http://www.uci.edu/">UC Irvine</a> &amp; UC San Diego. I worked at the <a href="http://www.calit2.uci.edu/">Irvine division</a> at the eHealth Center under Biomedical Engineering Professor Mark Bachman and Calit2 Irvine Director Professor G.P. Li.</p>

	<p>The Tele-immersive Operating System, or Telios, is a Web 2.0 telemedicine development platform. It was also a blanket term for the technologies that powered it. The purpose of Telios was to lower the barrier of entry by utilizing open-source software to enable technology that a patient may already have. The television and its remote control was the medium of choice, and interface design was targeted towards the elderly. The best description of the Telios vision can be read at the beginning of my <a href="GraduateSchool_StatementOfPurpose.pdf"><em>Statement of Purpose</em> [PDF]</a> for graduate school admission. The following poster presented at Medicine Meet Virtual Reality 18 (MMVR) summarizes Telios, as does the <a href="Telios_MMVR_Paper.pdf">written MMVR submission [PDF].</a></p>

	<p>Telios was composed of the following packages I developed:</p>

	  <li><a href="#H2O">H2O</a>: Vector-Like Web Interface Framework</li>

	</ul>

	<p>All widget applications and the Telios UI itself were built with some combination of these components. They were also used in the <a href="#ShareOurSelvesPNG">Share Our Selves PNG</a>.</p>

	<p>Undergraduate team member <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/allen-luo/23/937/298">Allen Luo</a> developed graphics for several widgets and assited in implementations. He also designed and implemented the <a href="http://telios.calit2.uci.edu">Telios website</a>.

	<p class="date">February 2010 - April 2011</p>

	<p>The <a href="http://www.connectedhealthca.org/scsni">Specialty Care Safety Net Initiative</a> (SCSNI) was a 2 year telehealth project funded by the California HealthCare Foundation. It used modern telemedicine equipment to connect 38 Safety Net clinics with the five UC medical schools to provide specialty care to underserved communities. Monies were used to pay specialists, to secure equipment, and to train referring clinics. The data was used to understand how such programs could be financially viable.</p>

	<p>I was brought onto SCSNI through Calit2 as technical support for the UC Irvine Medical Center, ensuring that the network and connected Polycom equipment was in working order. I trained specialists and even a group of medical students on the equipment and taught introductions to telehealth technology. I coordinated informatics with research data collection and wrote the associated IRB.</p>

	<p>Through this initiative I learned about electronic medical records, patient workflows, grants &amp; funding, insurance companies, safety net clinics &amp; FQHCs, Medi-Cal &amp; Medicare, the University of California, federal and state healthcare laws like HIPAA and HITECH, and the American healthcare system as a whole. It was a learning experience that deeply altered my personal thoughts on technology, education, healthcare, and government.</p>

	<!-- Summary -->
	<p>Opticon was an academic research experiment which used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory">constant comparative analysis</a> on patient interviews to formulate design requirements for a user-centered personal health management messaging system. Basically, we designed and implemented an web-application (Opticon) based on the needs communicated by chronic diabetics. Opticon required that the patient input their blood glucose level twice a day, morning &amp; evening. If the data wasn't received then a risk message was sent to their mobile phone via MMS. <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-milewski/21/169/614">Jim Milewski</a> had already done the interviews and analysis as part of other research, and I joined him for the design, implementation, and associated experiment.</p>

	<p>Associate of Science, Computer Science, May 2005</p>

	<p>Unlike the trend affecting many colleges and universities at the time (and today), the introductory and data structures curriculum at <a href="http://saddleback.edu/">Saddleback</a> was C++ based, and so I learned fundamentals in memory management and pointer arithmetic, template programming, and the STL.</p>
	
	<p>I started the Saddleback Computer Science Society in an effort to encourage Linux and open-source awareness. I organized trips to <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/">SCALE</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Linux_Summit">Desktop Linux Summit</a>.</p>

	<p>I worked a few hours a week as a CS Lab Assistant, supervising the lab and assisting other CS students in C++/STL and Java/AWT/Swing programming assignments.</p>

	<p>Prior to graduation I was awarded a Transfer Student Scholarship and the Computer Science Department Scholarship.</p>

	<p>Hexahex LLC was a company I created to cover all the independent work I did while in college, particularly since I was dealing with contracts and operations &amp; involving significant amounts of money. The majority of my work consisted of creating and hosting a few small websites for clients and provided IT support for a couple of small businesses.</p>

	<p>A futures trader requested a piece of software to analyze over 50 years of futures data according to his algorithms. The resulting application, "70% Futures", was written in C++ utilizing the STL and wxWidgets for the UI.</p>

	<p>A lender requested a loan application spreadsheet, which I created using Excel and Visual Basic for Applications. This may have been my small contribution to the subprime mortgage crisis.</p>

	<p>It is expensive to run a Limited Liability Company in California. Running a company full-time was even more costly to my college transcript. I don't recommend it, and now consider it a grave mistake, but the lessons learned will never be forgotten.</p>

	<p>I was brought in as a quality assurance contractor for a month during a release cycle panic. I didn't know it at the time, but I was actually in a startup environment.</p>

	<p>While I didn't do any programming I was familiar with the technologies used to build various components, including Java Swing and LAMP. I was given methods to do black box testing, but I extended these procedures to decision graphs covering all possible iterations of user interaction. It was a tedious but methodical procedure that found various bugs, some which rendered their software platform inoperable.</p>

	<p>The bugs I found polarized teams to the point where some wanted me out as soon as possible while other were rallying management to offer me a permanent job. At 22, this was my first experience in office politics! I declined discussions to work there permanently because I wanted to focus on school, as I was ready to transfer the upcoming academic year. Sometimes I wonder if I could have done both, but it had become clear that I stirred up the place.</p>

	<p>I designed this unorthodox curriculum vitae, or "course of (my) life", because I find the traditional resume structure boring, restricting, and unable to capture what project summaries with pictures and video can. I have heard anecdotally that resumes are rarely viewed or read thoroughly, so I have produced something that is somewhat enjoyable to read and engaging. If you can't appreciate this then I don't want to work for you.</p>
