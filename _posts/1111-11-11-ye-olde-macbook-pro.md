# Ye Olde Macbook Pro

My Macbook Pro (MBP) has been the best material gift I have ever received. Thanks dad.

He is a 2007 Model Number A1226. Santa Rosa chipset.

Named "Belugasitis" after the fictional disease plaguing a fantastical blue shark who believes he is a snake. No, the fact that he believes he's a snake is not the problem. Belugasitis is a skin condition. Don't ask.

## Upgrades & Repairs

This machine has seen its fair share of maintenance and upgrades. They are documented here.

### Solid State Hard Drive (TBC)

I've been debating an SSD for Belugasitis for quite some time, but I keep hearing mixed results and I have been reluctant to make the jump.

I've heard good things about the latest Intel and Samsung SSDs. From what I've read it seems it is safer to purchase a more modern SSD and rely on SATA's backwards compatibility than it is getting a dated, flawed model.

### ExpressCard SD Reader (TBC)

You know that little slot on the left-hand side you have never put anything into? Yup. How about an SD Card reader?

### Logic Board

The A1226 is plagued by the infamous [NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT defect](http://support.apple.com/kb/ts2377). It failed a couple of weeks before my AppleCare expired. To make matters worse, the computer and I were in Venezuela. Luckily my grandfather was traveling from Caracas to New York City the following week. Once there he sent it to my brother in California who took it to the Apple Store.

I was without Belugasitis for some time. I'm glad, as I needed a break from computers and technology. We were reunited several months later in Quito, Ecuador.

## End of Life?

It is known that the 2007 Macs are the oldest line of Mac to be supported by OS X Mountain Lion (10.8). It is very possible that newer versions of OS X will not support these Macs.

## The Final Upgrade

Power-wise she is hanging in there. She is still very capable of my every day tasks. She is on the heavy side though. She struggles a little with 1080p video and can't always read DVDs, but those are small details I can live with.

When my MBP is ready to move on to this next digital realm, she will be replaced by another Macbook. Either an 11" Air or a 13" Pro Retina. Until then, it will continue fighting the good fight against crappy design and mediocre code.
