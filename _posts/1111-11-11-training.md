# Train!

I was once morbidly obese, tipping the scales at over 240 lbs. Losing weight was a gradual process. The key was falling in love with physical activity, and I believe this is the secret to maintaining consistent exercise habits throughout life. A good friend first introduced me to road cycling and hiking. Eventually it was MMA and Brazilian Jiu-jitsu that pushed me past my limits and into new territory.

At my strongest I was a consistent 165. When I moved to Ecuador I lost quite a bit of muscle mass, and the combined change in diet and consistent passive exercise in the fat-burning zone dropped me down to a lean 152. Now after about 3 months in the USA I'm back up to the early 170s and it's all fat. I find that unacceptable, but I also believe one can maintain or even improve with sufficient discipline and knowledge.

The following is not exercise advice. I am not a fitness professional. This is simply my personal findings based on my MMA and BJJ training, fitness literature research, and personal experience.

## Military Standards

One way to gauge performance is to study what the military considers physically fit, and particularly, what constitutes failure. I figure if I am fit enough for the military then that's a start. It seems the US Marine Corps has the toughest standards for its recruits.

For the record, I am currently 30 years old, and have a height of 5'5" or 65 inches (1.65 m). USMC says I can weigh no more than 165 lbs (74.8 kg), and that I cannot have a body fat percentage greater than 18%.

## Running

I could never run well, for I have something worse than flat feet, a congenital deformation in both my ankle joints. I could never run more than a couple of miles without my ankles going out, but once I started running barefoot things changed.

(The following table is work in progress. I should probably code something nice, no?)

| Test | Length (mi) | Maximum Time | Mile Pace | 1/4 Mile Pace |
|:-----|:--------------:|:------------:|:---------:|:-------------:|
| FBI 300m | 0.186 | - | - | - |
| USMC IST | 1.5 | 13:30 | 9:00 | 2:15 |
| USN | 1.5 | 12:30 | - | - |
| USAF | 1.5 | 11:57 | 7:58 | 1:59 |
| USN BUD/S | 1.5 | 11:30 | - | - |
| USAF PAST | 1.5 | 10:30 | - | - |
| USA | 2.0 | 17:54 | 2:14 | - |
| USAF | 2.0 | 16:45 | - | - |
| USA Ranger | 2.0 | 15:12 | - | 1:54 |
| USMC | 3.0 | 29:00 | - | 2:24 |
| 5k | 3.2 | - | - | - |
| USA Ranger | 5.0 | 40:00 | - | - |
| 10k | 6.4 | - | - | - |

## Sit-ups

| Test | Length | Count | Group |
|:-----|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| USAF | 1:00 | 39 | 30-39 |
| USMC | 2:00 | 45 | 27-39 |
| USA | 2:00 | 45 | 27-31 |
| USN Diver | 2:00 | 50 | - |
| USA Ranger | 2:00 | 59 | - |

My core is the weakest link of my body. This is a shame, because it should be the strongest.

Whenever I workout, particularly weight training, I always do sit-ups first, starting 2 minutes of the traditional curl-up. I then follow with 2 minutes of the remaining exercises, in order listed. If I can't last that long without failure, then I do two successive 1 minute passes. 

**Hector's Ab Circuit**

* Curl-ups aka Sit-ups
* Flutter Kicks
* [Bicycles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BE6-ERFInA) 
* Scissors
* Levers aka Leg Lifts
* Frog leg Crunches
* Oblique Twists
* Sidebends (if dumbbells available)
* [Vacuums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_exercise)

I alternate the order of Flutter Kicks and Thai Bicycles. Both can be brutal for two minutes, especially after the curl-ups for quantity.

I hold my Vacuums for as long as possible as I'm practicing static apnea as a secondary exercise.

Notice I don't include traditional crunches. Everybody includes crunches and I'm sick of doing them, particularly because emphasis is placed on speed and not control. As a result they put too much strain on my neck. The frog leg variation seems to attack my abdominals more clearly when done in a controlled manner.

Also when I shadow box with weights, I do so at a fraction of my top speed, emphasizing movement from my core. This always seem to get my obliques and lower back.

## Swimming

| Test | Length | Maximum Time |
|:-----|:------:|:------------:|
| USN Diver | 500m | 14:00 |
| USN BUD/S | 500y | 12:30 |
| SAR | 500y | 12:00 | 

## Weight Training

The following is Bruce Lee's workout. [Bruce Lee Workout](http://www.motleyhealth.com/fitness/bruce-lee-workout)

| Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|:---------|:----:|:----:|
| Clean & Press | 2 | 8 |
| Squats | 2 | 12 |
| Pullovers | 2 | 8 |
| Bench Press | 2 | 6 |
| Good Morning | 2 | 8 |
| Curls | 2 | 8 |

If I manage to find myself in a gym I try to circuit train. I quickly lose focus doing traditional strength building with rests between sets. Circuit training prevents boredom and adds always needed cardio. I tend to cycle between two different exercises, eliminating the rest in between sets. I then move to another two.

## Why are you doing this?

There are hundreds of thousands of men, just in the USA, capable of this and more. Each is a potential friend or foe. Si vis pacem, para bellum.
